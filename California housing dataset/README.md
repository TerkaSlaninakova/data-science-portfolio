# California housing dataset
A nice dataset I came across while doing [Google ML crash course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course). Some of the solutions are taken from there (mainly model creation), some are my own.

Model(s) used: Tensorflow's LinearRegressor

- Step 2: Perfecting the model (hyperparam. tuning)
- Step 3: Feature engineering, outlier detection
