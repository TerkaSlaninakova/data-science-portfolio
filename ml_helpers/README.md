# Machine learning helpers
Collection of my personal set of libraries and functions that come in handy in an arbitraty data science task.

Written with reasonable amount of abstraction in mind, so that they're usable e.g. in a Jupyter notebook and allow for neat flow without hiding too much.

A lot of code is taken from [fast.ai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) and stackoverflow tips.
